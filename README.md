**Current Model:** llama3.2:3b (basic analysis)

For better code understanding and more detailed analysis, we recommend upgrading to:
- **llama3.2:7b** (recommended) - Better context, detailed analysis
- **llama3.2:11b** (premium) - Maximum performance for large codebases

**Quick Upgrade:**
```bash
docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.2:7b
# Edit Server/src/services/llmService.js and change MODEL = 'llama3.2:7b'
docker-compose restart api
```
